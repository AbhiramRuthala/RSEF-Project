# RSEF-Project

This project details key code/software important for the Alzheimer-tracking project. 

The project involves training an ML model to be able to understand differences in speech patterns between an AD patient and a normal patient. It then looks to compare live speech of a person to its configurations to see if a person potentially has Alzheimer's Disease or has the chance to develop it.
